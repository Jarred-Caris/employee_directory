## Installation
none

## Technology
React, html, javascript, css  

## Success
React was another leap in my learning. There is a huge amount to learn but i maintained my little bits and pieces from the lessons. I was able to use the previous homework to lay the skeleton relatively quickly. Then moved onto the main parts.....

## Holdbacks
This is where the struggle began for me. the api call was the first thing i needed to get sorted out. this took probably the longest for me. It was a great deal of trial and error, watching youtube tutorials, bouncing ideas through my study group and alot of thinking. The second part was the sort function, i was very close to having this done but couldnt quite get it to work. i was able to get the bugs out with the help of our tutor and TA.

In saying this, i am still not able to get the filter to work. I have tried multiple ways and just cant seem to get it to stick. So im submitting what I have now to beable to move onto the next activities to avoid falling behind.
